      <description>Friends,
I believe the Town of Castine can and should do more to support our merchants. We often talk about attracting families to Castine to rent or buy, but when you ask most folks how they found Castine they&amp;rsquo;ve either been here their whole lives (summer, student, long-time resident), or they discovered it on a vacation or a day-trip.
When I helped start the Castine Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market almost a decade ago, there were vendors and farmers excited to sell who had never actually been to Castine before.</description>
