      <title>What&#39;s in your wastewater?</title>

      <description>Would you believe medications flushed down the toilet can actually be read in our wastewater facility? Pills do not dissolve as quickly as you may think, and that may be a good thing. While a recent event allowed a municipal employee to be able to identify a particular medication type that came through our treatment facility, the real story is that this happened at all.
Disposing of things can be tricky business.</description>

      <description>A substantial part of the select board&amp;rsquo;s job is communicating effectively with the public. I will acknowledge before we get started here that not everyone is on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc.). Even more, many people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how they work. But for those who do use it, and understand at least at a basic level how it works, social media can be transformative.
More than a place to share funny pictures of cats with your friends, Facebook can be used to spread news of upcoming events, to receive RSVPs to those events, and to share ocmments ideas or documents.</description>

      <description>Had a nice introduction to the MMA Board of Trustees this morning. Town Manager Jimmy Goodson notified the Board that Dave Unger had finished his tenure on the selectboard and that I was stepping into the role. I received a warm applause and good conversation after the meeting adjourned.
I also had a fascinating conversation with Trustee Bob Peacock from Eastport about the impact of the two major hurricanes in Texas and Florida on the restaurant and food distribution industries, which is the focus of his company.</description>

      <title>Our Merchants Need Our Help!</title>

      <description>Friends,
I believe the Town of Castine can and should do more to support our merchants. We often talk about attracting families to Castine to rent or buy, but when you ask most folks how they found Castine they&amp;rsquo;ve either been here their whole lives (summer, student, long-time resident), or they discovered it on a vacation or a day-trip.
When I helped start the Castine Farmers&amp;rsquo; Market almost a decade ago, there were vendors and farmers excited to sell who had never actually been to Castine before.</description>

      <description>Dear residents of Castine,
I am asking for your vote on November 7, 2017 for the privilage of becoming your next selectman.
Responsible governance does not appear out of thin air. It does not show up because we want it. It is the hard work of dedicated individuals who are passionate about their town.
As your next selectman:
I promise to be a passionate supporter of Castine and all our shared friends and neighbors.</description>

      <title>Snow on the sidewalks</title>

      <description>We had an interesting dicsussion at our select board meeting this week about clearing snow from the sidewalks. The question asked was, why would we pay so much to put in nice sidewalks only to leave them essentially un-passable in the winter? Unfortunately the many of the board and municipal officer&amp;rsquo;s answers seemed unsatisfying to the public attendees of the meeting. Here&amp;rsquo;s my take, and recognize that this is just my opinion.</description>

      <description>Castine voters,
Thank you so much for your passionate support and most especially your vote at the polls this year! When you choose to run for public office, there is a vulnerability that you must reconcile before you get to work changing hearts and minds with your ideas. That reconciliation happened so quickly for me in this election primarily because this town is such a positive, supportive community.
Folk singer Greg Brown has a live album on which, in between two songs, he tells a story about living in a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</description>

      <description>Castiners, I want to make it clear that when I refer to my new position I will be using the term &amp;ldquo;selectperson.&amp;rdquo; That is intentional, and is not some crazy progressive ideology, it&amp;rsquo;s simply an acknowledgment that when you tack &amp;lsquo;-men&amp;rsquo; on the end of something it is passively exclusive.
The term originates from the idea that these &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rdquo; were &amp;ldquo;selected&amp;rdquo; to lead the town. Given that etymology, it only makes sense that if we hope to be exclusive to all humanity we should consider ourselves and any who would take up the position &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;selected&amp;rdquo; to lead the town.</description>
