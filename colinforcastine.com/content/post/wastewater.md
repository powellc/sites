Would you believe medications flushed down the toilet can actually be read in
our wastewater facility? Pills do not dissolve as quickly as you may think, and
that may be a good thing. While a recent event allowed a municipal employee to
be able to identify a particular medication type that came through our treatment
facility, the real story is that this happened at all.

Disposing of things can be tricky business. It's not always clear what one
should do with things they don't want anymore, especially for things like
controlled substances. What we can emphatically say you should NOT do, is flush
things down the toilet. The Town of Castine spends a lot of resources carefully
removing most waste products from the water that goes down your drains, toilets
and outdoor sewers. Thus, when you introduce things into that water stream that
are non-standard, the wastewater facility has to deal with it.

In this case, prescription or over-the-counter medications are a significant
problem. In large urban areas, studies are beginning to discover serious issues
with medications reaching our public water supplies, oceans, lakes and rivers. A
few weeks ago, one of our wastewater facility employees discovered anti-seizure
medications that had gone down the drain. While these pills were caught, easy
dissolving pills might not have, and that medication would have joined the
(mostly clean) wastewater as it is disposed of via over-board discharge into
Oakum Bay.

When you're flushing something, ask yourself, would I want to see this in
Castine Harbor? If the answer is no, call Town Hall and ask for the appropriate
way to dispose of your waste. In the case of medications, you can take them to
the Bucksport Police Department or the Hancock County Sheriff's office in
Ellsworth. Either location will happily and safely dispose of them for free.
