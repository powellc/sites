Castiners, I want to make it clear that when I refer to my new position I will
be using the term "selectperson." That is intentional, and is not some crazy
progressive ideology, it's simply an acknowledgment that when you tack '-men' on
the end of something it is passively exclusive.

The term originates from the idea that these "men" were "selected" to lead the
town. Given that etymology, it only makes sense that if we hope to be exclusive
to all humanity we should consider ourselves and any who would take up the
position "people" "selected" to lead the town.

I may from time to time continue to use the old term, but I will do my best to
refer to the position as a selectperson.
