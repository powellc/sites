A substantial part of the select board's job is communicating effectively with
the public. I will acknowledge before we get started here that not everyone is
on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc.). Even more, many
people don't understand how they work. But for those who do use it, and
understand at least at a basic level how it works, social media can be
transformative.

More than a place to share funny pictures of cats with your friends, Facebook
can be used to spread news of upcoming events, to receive RSVPs to those events,
and to share ocmments ideas or documents. When you put it like that, a
muncipality that's not at least doing something on Facebook is likely missing a
huge opportunity for engagment. Solicit ideas? Post ideas? Receive feedback?
Announce meetings? Isn't that what a responsive government is always attempting
to do?

I am proposing a social media policy to be adopted by the Castine Select Board.
My goal is to present a first draft of such a policy at our December 18 select
board meeting. The policy will dicate who has access to post to municipal social
media accounts, expectations for behavior of those posting, what constitues
abuse online, and the consequences for those who would abuse the municipal
accounts online.

Many other municipalities and organizations use social media on a regular basis
to communicate with their constituents. The opportunity for Castine is to
provide faster response times to issues, spreading the word to more people about
meetings, hearings and work sessions, and generally enriching our government.

My hope is that this social media policy will allow us to communicate more
effectively as a municipal government. But I also want to make sure everyone has
a chance to weigh in with their questions and concerns. I encourage you to
either talk to me in person, on the phone, via social media, or come to our
December 18 board meeting.
