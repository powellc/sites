Castine voters,

Thank you so much for your passionate support and most
especially your vote at the polls this year! When you choose to run for public
office, there is a vulnerability that you must reconcile before you get to work
changing hearts and minds with your ideas. That reconciliation happened so
quickly for me in this election primarily because this town is such a positive,
supportive community.

Folk singer Greg Brown has a live album on which, in between two songs, he tells
a story about living in a small town in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Winters
are hard in the UP, and he explained that you have to know your neighbors when
the weather howls, and life throws challenges in your path.  Community is
created when we need each other, not when we want community. "You have to need
each other," says Brown.

I need you! And I need my neighbors. Let's embrace that need and get work moving
Castine into the future. Please communicate with me early and often with your
ideas. I can't promise I'll act on all of them, but the only way we know what
people need is by communicating with one another.

In the next few weeks I'll be working with my fellow selectpeople to setup some
new lines of communication with the municipal government. I'll also be touring
town facilities and talking with town employees about what they need, or see as
needs for other members of our community.

Thank you again, and I am so excited to be your next selectperson!
