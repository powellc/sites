Sometimes I forget things. Mostly I forget things. Very little of what happens in a given day is remembered. What you find here, at my very own vanity URL and content repository are the things I'm hoping will help me remember all those things I've forgotten. It hasn't worked perfectly yet. And let's be honest, it's unlikely to ever work perfectly. But as the ancient Welsh proverb says, "perfection is the enemy of getting anything at all close to complete."

What you will most probably find here, then, are things about things that I'm actively learning about. Hopefully they're useful me. If we're really lucky, they'll be useful to you, my diligent reader, too.
