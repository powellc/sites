I'm officially going to be on the ballot in Castine for selectmen this year!

Turned in my nomination papers, and, pending a review of the voter signature, I
will be on the ballot along with Patrick Haugen and Buzz Layton. It was a lot
of fun talking to folks about the town while collecting signature, and I'm
feeling really blessed to be in a community that not only provides me the
opportunity to run for public office, but one where my friends and neighbors
are actively enthuiastic about my campaign.

Next stop, election day!
