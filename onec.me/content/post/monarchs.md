I knew that monarch butterflies were born somewhere in the north and then
migrated to Mexico for the winter. But today on a hike on Sears Island we got to
see a field of wildflowers, predominently milkweed, that was set aside
specifically for monarchs to develop in.

Indeed, we saw a few monarch caterpillers, which interesting actually share a
color pattern with their flying form.

Our enthusiasm was dampened slightly when the flying insects came out. They
specifically seemed to want our lunch and recent traumatic events involving
ground hornets meant we had to make a hasty retreat.

The hike ended up being almost two miles and was through some really pretty
paths. I would definitely enjoy hiking on Sears Island again.
