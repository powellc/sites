Once, I used Jekyll. Then I switched to Pelican. I'm finally here on Hugo, and
hoping that this will make it easier to keep things updated. The eternal
question when chosing a method to publish a blog is, why publish a blog. I don't
really have an answer for that yet. I wish I did. Honestly, I do. You don't have
to believe me, because I believe in myself, and if this is all one big
simulation, you don't matter anyway.

Incidentally, perhaps the best part of this transition is the
[ox-hugo](<https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/>) plugin, which makes writing new posts
and publishing them a dream. Now, instead of some complicated cocktail of adding
a new file with the write filename and proper metadata, I can just org-mode
capture the thing. The more I use emacs (and specifically
[spacemacs](<http://spacemacs.org>)), the more in love I am.
