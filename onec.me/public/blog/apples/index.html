      <p>Sitting in a coffee shop surrounded by people tapping away on Macbooks I can
help but remember my freshman year in college. One of my floor RLAs was a total
Mac cultist who owned multiple aging machines, included a G3 that he desperately
wanted to get Apache running on. OS 9 was less hospitable to POSIX toolchains
then. He did get it to work eventually, and I was impressed, but I sure as hell
wasn&rsquo;t going to buy a Mac myself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard in hindsight to realize how bad things were in that world. OS 9 was
the sort of OS only a mother could love. So many quirks that made using it an
exercise in self-punishement.</p>

<p>But Jobs rose the Phoneix from the ashes. And now here I sit having to eat my
words about Apple being dead. It&rsquo;s amazing how much one person can have an
impact on the world. Thinking on a flight recently, it occurred to me that if
half of the billionaires in the world had the vision of Gates or Musk, where
might the world be?</p>
