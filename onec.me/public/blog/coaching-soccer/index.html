  <meta name="description" content="This is my second year coaching the middle school soccer team here in Castine. Each year I am filled with apprehension about the make up of the team, and wether coaching is actually something I can do. All those kids, just looking at you to say something, anything really, so long as it relates to soccer.
And yet here I am. My second year of telling kids what to do. Interestingly, what&amp;rsquo;s most stood out from year to year is the growth of the players." />

      <p>This is my second year coaching the middle school soccer team here in Castine.
Each year I am filled with apprehension about the make up of the team, and
wether coaching is actually something I can do. All those kids, just looking at
you to say something, anything really, so long as it relates to soccer.</p>

<p>And yet here I am. My second year of telling kids what to do. Interestingly,
what&rsquo;s most stood out from year to year is the growth of the players. Fifth
graders last year who had trouble paying attention and looked at me like I was
speaking Greek when I told them to hustle to the ball, have become easily
motivated. Older players seem almost excited to step into leadership roles,
whether in the goal or taking a midfield position with lots of running.</p>

<p>Really, it&rsquo;s the same as watching my own kids grow up. The miracle of humanity
is how we grow and develop our own personality quirks and motivations which are
at once totally our own, and also clearly cobbled together by experiences we&rsquo;ve
shared. For my part, I love it.</p>
