                <p>I knew that monarch butterflies were born somewhere in the north and then
migrated to Mexico for the winter. But today on a hike on Sears Island we got to
see a field of wildflowers, predominently milkweed, that was set aside
specifically for monarchs to develop in.</p>

<p>Indeed, we saw a few monarch caterpillers, which interesting actually share a
color pattern with their flying form.</p>

<p>Our enthusiasm was dampened slightly when the flying insects came out. They
specifically seemed to want our lunch and recent traumatic events involving
ground hornets meant we had to make a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The hike ended up being almost two miles and was through some really pretty
paths. I would definitely enjoy hiking on Sears Island again.</p>
