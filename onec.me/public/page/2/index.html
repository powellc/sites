      <p>This is my second year coaching the middle school soccer team here in Castine.
Each year I am filled with apprehension about the make up of the team, and
wether coaching is actually something I can do. All those kids, just looking at
you to say something, anything really, so long as it relates to soccer.</p>

<p>And yet here I am. My second year of telling kids what to do. Interestingly,
what&rsquo;s most stood out from year to year is the growth of the players. Fifth
graders last year who had trouble paying attention and looked at me like I was
speaking Greek when I told them to hustle to the ball, have become easily
motivated. Older players seem almost excited to step into leadership roles,
whether in the goal or taking a midfield position with lots of running.</p>

<p>Really, it&rsquo;s the same as watching my own kids grow up. The miracle of humanity
is how we grow and develop our own personality quirks and motivations which are
at once totally our own, and also clearly cobbled together by experiences we&rsquo;ve
shared. For my part, I love it.</p>

      <p>The gospel of Matthew suggests that Christ&rsquo;s heaven is an equal opportunity
saver. That is, it is not a place where those who worked the hardest receive the
best, or those who took and never gave suffer. The parable of the vineyard
laborers more or less spells out a universal salvation message for those who
would be willing to work, not for how much they work. And, as a parable, that
means that those who come to find love and compassion late in life are no less
entitled to salvation than anyone else.</p>

<p>In Unitarian Universalism, this reflects very accurately what we mean in our
second principle. We affirm justice, equity and compassion in human relations.
Note, carefully, that we do not include equality in what we affirm. Equality is
a difficult concept for humans to hold in their minds, because it suggests that
everyone needs the same thing. Instead, let us focus our energy on providing
justice and equity. Because the abused child may need more love and patient
understanding than the child raised in a loving home. The diversity and color of
conditions that humans live in exclude the possibility of anything ever being
equal when it comes to love.</p>

<p>Instead let us strive for equity and considered justice, ensuring that needs are
being met and that we are working towards making everyone whole. Indeed,
laborers who did not have the advantage of being there at the start of the day
deserve their full payment all the same.</p>

      <p>One of the aspects of my faith that I have the most difficulty with is accepting
other people regardless of where they are. As a human, I like to hang with
people like me. This is understandable, as tribalism exists in the world as an
artifact of the world we have lived in for the last 10,000 years.</p>

<p>And yet, UUism calls me to be accepting of others and to encourage others in
their spiritual growth. How can I be tribal and accepting of others at the same
time? I think a big part of that practice is being honest with yourself about
the biases you may have. I value thoughtfulness and intelligence highly. I do
not place as much value on art and entertainment. It is not that I don&rsquo;t like
those things, but someone who orients their life around art make it immediately
more difficult for me to find similarities and to enjoy their company.</p>

<p>The best thing I&rsquo;ve found in these situations is to keep plumbing for
commonality. As awkward as tribalism can be, it&rsquo;s also a fantastic tool to build
affinity for other people. If you can intentionally try to build a tribe with
strangers, before you know it they are no longer a stranger and instead part of
a new tribe that you just created. Maybe they have kids. I have kids and know
that world all too well. Perhaps they have a Mormon grandmother who is difficult
to be around :) Yet another opportunity to build the community that was missing
before.</p>

<p>The trick is not to disavow the aspects of our human psychology that make us
able to accept others, but use them to our advantage to grow our tribe larger,
or at least increase the number of small tribes we&rsquo;re a part of.</p>

      <p>An interesting discussion occurred at work today where I was forced to put into
words some thoughts I&rsquo;ve been kicking around for a while on the nature of
leadership. None of my thoughts are original, mind you. This one was cribbed
from a blog post about leading without authority. I&rsquo;ll drop the link when I find
it. The long and the short of that post was that leadership has only the loosest
relationship with authority. In fact, it&rsquo;s often a sign of dysfunctional
leadership which depends on having someone give you authority.</p>

<p>In the world of power, authority is one of the most difficult types to wield,
because it generally means someone has placed an expectation on you. You will be
forced to live up to those expectations or be cut down from your place of
authority quickly. Meanwhile, leadership is not actually a type of power, but a
behavior. This alone should be mind-blowing if you&rsquo;re actually following along
at home.</p>

<p>You can lead without authority. You can lead with authority. You can actually
lead without saying a thing. This is key tenant in modern stoicism, actually.
Don&rsquo;t tell, do. And so it is in leadership as well. Don&rsquo;t tell people what to
do, show them what is effective, and empathize with their plight.</p>

<p>One of the more disappointing interactions I had recently was when a co-worker
expressed a lack of joy in his work. It struck a nerve with me, in that I had
felt many of the same things. And our lead engineer, who tends to lead through
authority rather than trust, kind, sort of, well &hellip; blew us off. I really
didn&rsquo;t see that coming, and it&rsquo;s forced me to take a step back and realize that
I need to do a better job of leading without authority. Of building trust
amongst my co-workers so that when the need arises, I can step up.</p>

      <p>What does it mean to encourage others towards spiritual growth? At a recent
board meeting, which included a fairly contentious issue, a number of friends
and myself certainly did not encourage anyone towards spiritual growth. The root
of the problem, as with many problems, lies with differences; differences of
opinion, experience, and expectations. As a Unitarian Universalist congregation,
we espouse the seven principles, which are as close to dogma as you&rsquo;re likely to
see in UUism. One of these seven &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of behavior as a UU calls us to
accept others and help them towards spiritual growth. How can we do that when
we&rsquo;re so different?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m repeating myself here, but repetition is the best way to learn anything, so
let&rsquo;s go again. Difference tends to cause us to build walls. Often we do not do
so intentionally, but humans are animals, and there is a base tribalness to much
of what animals do. It should not surprise us that we like to be with our own
kind, to have our ideas reinforced, to spend time with those we&rsquo;ve shared
experiences. But that gets to the crux of it. Share experiences with other
people. Embrace our tribalness to create connections with people who are
currently strangers. This is not radical acceptance. If you believe that
abortion is a sin against your chosen diety, that is not a good place to begin
acceptance. Rather, why not talk about youre experience with your children? Talk
about sports, the weather, and begin to ask questions.</p>

<p>Do you know where the members on your board were born? Where they were raised?
What they personally believe? The stand out experiences in their lives? Their
favorite books? Movies? What they love? What drives them crazy? These are not
retorical questions. Nor are they questions that I have asked yet. So no need to
feel bad. Being an accepting and welcoming human being is difficult preciscely
because of our earlier manifestation as uncooperative animals. But by some
miracle have developed the skills of discernment and cooperation, and we should
perform social exercises to keep our open-ness well conditioned.</p>
