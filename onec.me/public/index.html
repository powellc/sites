      <p>Once, I used Jekyll. Then I switched to Pelican. I&rsquo;m finally here on Hugo, and
hoping that this will make it easier to keep things updated. The eternal
question when chosing a method to publish a blog is, why publish a blog. I don&rsquo;t
really have an answer for that yet. I wish I did. Honestly, I do. You don&rsquo;t have
to believe me, because I believe in myself, and if this is all one big
simulation, you don&rsquo;t matter anyway.</p>

<p>Incidentally, perhaps the best part of this transition is the
<a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> plugin, which makes writing new posts
and publishing them a dream. Now, instead of some complicated cocktail of adding
a new file with the write filename and proper metadata, I can just org-mode
capture the thing. The more I use emacs (and specifically
<a href="http://spacemacs.org">spacemacs</a>), the more in love I am.</p>

      <p>Sitting in a coffee shop surrounded by people tapping away on Macbooks I can
help but remember my freshman year in college. One of my floor RLAs was a total
Mac cultist who owned multiple aging machines, included a G3 that he desperately
wanted to get Apache running on. OS 9 was less hospitable to POSIX toolchains
then. He did get it to work eventually, and I was impressed, but I sure as hell
wasn&rsquo;t going to buy a Mac myself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard in hindsight to realize how bad things were in that world. OS 9 was
the sort of OS only a mother could love. So many quirks that made using it an
exercise in self-punishement.</p>

<p>But Jobs rose the Phoneix from the ashes. And now here I sit having to eat my
words about Apple being dead. It&rsquo;s amazing how much one person can have an
impact on the world. Thinking on a flight recently, it occurred to me that if
half of the billionaires in the world had the vision of Gates or Musk, where
might the world be?</p>

      <p>Campaigning has been a very interesting trip. The most memoroable aspect of
running for select board so far has been finding people standing up along side
me and asking how they can help me gain a seat at the table. Mostly, that&rsquo;s
because I tend to think of myself as a relatively unimportant person. And I am,
even now. Yet my desire to serve the town intersects with a lot of other folks&rsquo;
desires for their town, and I&rsquo;m amazed that they see me as someone who can help
them.</p>

<p>Mostly, what that means to me is that this has become a responsibility. Not that
I didn&rsquo;t already know that to a certain degree, but extent to which service is
really responsiblity has fully dawned on me now.</p>

      <p>The way I was raised, certain people were simply wrong. If they didn&rsquo;t share the same enthusiasm for science, they were incorrect. If they believed in a benevolent (or even malevolent) Christian god, they were wrong. There was very little gray in many of the positions that were espoused to me. One of the great aspects of humanity is that we are given the opportunity to raise our children with our values and beliefs. But, of course, there are responsibilities there too.</p>

<p>It almost seems absurd to say this, but I don&rsquo;t think I was always responsibly educated. Absurd, because that&rsquo;s a high bar and I&rsquo;m not sure anyone can ever claim to have been educated under the perfect paradigm. But to the extent that it took me many years to understand what it means to pursue a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, I think there could have been more openess to what I was exposed to.  The Christian Bible is an amazing book. The Bhagavad Gita is absolutely beautiful. Darwin had his doubts about the extent to which evolution allows us to understand life. Newton was downright crazy half the time.</p>

<p>The source of responsibility in our lives is humbleness.  When we say we are responsible for our children, that does not mean if we fail to teach them the right things we have failed.  It means if we fail to listen to them, and discern what they need based on what we understand about them and what they tell us, we have failed them.  There is no test for responsible parenthood, just as there is no test of responsible searching for meaning in our lives.  When we have the freedom to search for truth and meaning, we must use discernment and listening as our foundation for responsibility. Listen first, think second, act last.</p>

      <p>Emacs is very powerful. Amazingly so. But it&rsquo;s so arcane, the keystrokes could
take you years to master. So what&rsquo;s a developer to do?</p>

<p>Enter spacemacs. I honestly don&rsquo;t know where this idea came from, and my brain
is structured in such a way that I could have ever pulled it off myself. But an
emacs configured like Vim (thank you evil mode) with discoverable keystrokes &hellip;
I am always flabergasted.</p>

<p>Tonight I discovered how to open the kill ring. While it sounds aggressive, it&rsquo;s
really just Emacs version of a clipboard. Anything you cut or copy ends up on
the kill ring. For so long I treated it like the opaque clipboard on so many
operating systems. The last thing I cut is the only thing I have access to. And
God help me if I cut something else, because I&rsquo;ll lose the last thing to
oblivion.</p>

<p>But not anymore, baby. With an interactive kill ring (SPC-r-y for those of you
following along at home) you get a searchable compendium of everything you&rsquo;ve
cut or copied in the current session. Absolutely brilliant.</p>
