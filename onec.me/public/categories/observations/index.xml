      <description>Sitting in a coffee shop surrounded by people tapping away on Macbooks I can help but remember my freshman year in college. One of my floor RLAs was a total Mac cultist who owned multiple aging machines, included a G3 that he desperately wanted to get Apache running on. OS 9 was less hospitable to POSIX toolchains then. He did get it to work eventually, and I was impressed, but I sure as hell wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to buy a Mac myself.</description>
