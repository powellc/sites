      <description>One of the aspects of my faith that I have the most difficulty with is accepting other people regardless of where they are. As a human, I like to hang with people like me. This is understandable, as tribalism exists in the world as an artifact of the world we have lived in for the last 10,000 years.
And yet, UUism calls me to be accepting of others and to encourage others in their spiritual growth.</description>
