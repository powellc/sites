      <description>I knew that monarch butterflies were born somewhere in the north and then migrated to Mexico for the winter. But today on a hike on Sears Island we got to see a field of wildflowers, predominently milkweed, that was set aside specifically for monarchs to develop in.
Indeed, we saw a few monarch caterpillers, which interesting actually share a color pattern with their flying form.
Our enthusiasm was dampened slightly when the flying insects came out.</description>
