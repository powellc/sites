      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re all entitled to having off days, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them any easier to work around. I woke up today without much ambition, despite the fact that we have chickens that need to be slaughtered. To add insult to injury, after we decided not to worry about slaughter, I went downstairs to discover that the toilet is not filling. There&amp;rsquo;s simply no water in the supply line. To make things weirder, the sink that&amp;rsquo;s on the same line works fine.</description>

      <description>I knew that monarch butterflies were born somewhere in the north and then migrated to Mexico for the winter. But today on a hike on Sears Island we got to see a field of wildflowers, predominently milkweed, that was set aside specifically for monarchs to develop in.
Indeed, we saw a few monarch caterpillers, which interesting actually share a color pattern with their flying form.
Our enthusiasm was dampened slightly when the flying insects came out.</description>
